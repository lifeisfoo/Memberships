# Memberships plugin for Vanilla Forums
This plugin allows users to be assigned to groups created by the Groups plugin. 

## Features 
* /groups page to show groups list
* /groups/group-name page to show group's members
* user's memberships info showed in profile page
* users can select a group in they profile page
* re-use Memberships plugin saved information (configuration and users memberships)

Taken together, the two plugins create a backend that can be used to build group-based features into other plugins and themes.

Requires Vanilla >= 2.0
